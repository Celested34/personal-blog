My primary passion is working towards being a champion of equal rights, equal access, & the elimination of all forms of discrimination. As a Latinx woman I experience the negative effects of a lack in diversity, such as not seeing myself being represented in the tech community. This has made my journey of learning to code riddled with imposter syndrome. Which is why I am hoping that this portfolio serves recruiters for job searching purposes and others in my community seeing a Latinx woman taking up space in the tech sector.
