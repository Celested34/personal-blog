                <h2>Few Words About Me</h2>
                <p> My primary passion is working towards being a champion of equal rights, equal access, & the elimination of all forms of discrimination. As a Latinx woman I experience the negative effects of a lack in diversity, such as not seeing myself being represented in the tech community. This has made my journey of learning to code riddled with imposter syndrome. Which is why I am hoping that this portfolio serves recruiters for job searching purposes and others in my community seeing a Latinx woman taking up space in the tech sector.  
                </p>
                
                <h2> My Background </h2>
                <p2>
                    My time as a technical recruiter exposed me to people working in the tech field, specifically developers. And in time my interest in programming grew slowly, at first it was by interviewing developers at work and eventually taking time off learning to code through online classes.
